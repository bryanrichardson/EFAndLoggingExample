EFAndLoggingExample
===================

Demonstrates updating a database, logging and sending emails when a record is deleted


The database should be created when you run the tests in the test project.

All tests should go green.  There are tests for the models and the repository but no tests for the controller yet.

The website should come up when you run the solution.  
You can add, edit, and delete movies to the list and all calls to the controller except the initial page load are done via AJAX.
